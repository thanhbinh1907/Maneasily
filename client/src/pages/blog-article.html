        <p>We’ve all been there. You have a big deadline looming, but instead of working, you find yourself cleaning your desk, scrolling through social media, or suddenly deciding it’s the perfect time to learn how to bake sourdough. This is procrastination in its classic form.</p>
        <p>But fear not! Beating procrastination isn't about finding a magic "motivation" button. It's about building better systems and habits. Here are five simple, actionable ways to stop putting things off and start getting them done.</p>

        <h2>1. The 5-Minute Rule</h2>
        <p>The hardest part of any task is starting. The 5-Minute Rule is simple: if a task takes less than five minutes, do it immediately. If it's a larger task, just commit to working on it for *only* five minutes. More often than not, you'll find that once you've started, you'll build momentum and keep going.</p>

        <h2>2. Break It Down</h2>
        <p>A large project like "Write Research Paper" is overwhelming. This ambiguity is what makes us want to avoid it. Instead, break it down into small, concrete, and manageable steps.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wrong: "Write Research Paper"</li>
          <li>Right: "Create outline," "Find 5 sources," "Write introduction," "Draft Section 1."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A long list of small, checkable tasks is far less intimidating and gives you a clear roadmap.</p>

        <h2>3. Use Time Blocking</h2>
        <p>Instead of a vague to-do list, give every task a specific time and place in your calendar. "Work on presentation from 10 AM to 11 AM." This turns your intention into a concrete plan and protects your time from other distractions.</p>

        <h2>4. Identify Your "Why"</h2>
        <p>Sometimes we procrastinate because the task feels meaningless. Take a moment to connect the task to a larger goal. You're not just "filling out a spreadsheet"; you're "updating the budget so the team can get the resources it needs."</p>
        
        <blockquote>"Don't wait. The time will never be just right. Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command." - George Herbert</blockquote>

        <h2>5. Remove Distractions</h2>
        <p>This seems obvious, but it's the most effective. If you get distracted by your phone, put it in another room. If you get distracted by email, close your inbox. Create an environment where the easiest thing to do is the task you're supposed to be doing.</p>
